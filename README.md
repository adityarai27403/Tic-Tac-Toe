The Tic Tac Toe project in Python involves creating a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The game continues until one player achieves a winning pattern or the grid is filled without a winner. It's a great beginner project for practicing Python fundamentals like loops, conditions, and functions, and can be expanded with features like AI opponents for more advanced implementations.
